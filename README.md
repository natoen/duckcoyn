# Crypto Coin Spike Alerter

A Slack alerter written in Go whenever there is a spike in Binance. The criteria
of a spike is self made. There was DB migrations, testings, and output files
here before if you are looking at the commits but ultimately this became just a
hobby to see if volume base anomaly will cause a spike. No. No profit was made
during this hobby.

### How to run

- you should have Go installed
- `go run main.go`

### Others

Comments were added here at the last minute for the readers to make it
friendlier. The keys committed here before are all disabled. This repo will go
back into a private after some time.
