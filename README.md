# Crypto Coin Spike Alerter

A [Slack alerter](https://github.com/natoen/duckcoyn/blob/0f99beca52cf048d866319a40f089581e86455d2/helpers/helpers.go#L134) written in Go whenever there is a spike in Binance. The criteria
of a spike is self made. If you are looking at the commits, there was DB migrations,
testings, and output files here before but ultimately this became just a hobby to
see if volume base anomaly will cause a spike. No profit was made during this hobby.

### How to run

- you should have Go installed
- `go run main.go`

### Others

Comments were added here at the last minute for the readers to make it

back into a private after some time.
